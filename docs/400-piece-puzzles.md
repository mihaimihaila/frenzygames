Jigsaw Puzzle Frenzy is a fun and relaxing video game that lets you enjoy solving beautiful jigsaw puzzles on your Windows device. You can choose from hundreds of stunning images, customize your puzzles, and challenge yourself with different levels of difficulty.

One of the most exciting features of Jigsaw Puzzle Frenzy is the ability to play 400 piece puzzles, which are the most challenging and rewarding puzzles in the game. However, this feature is only available for premium subscribers who have access to the full version of the game.

If you are not a premium subscriber yet, you will see a red padlock icon on the 400 piece option in the customize puzzle dialog. This means that you cannot play 400 piece puzzles unless you upgrade to the premium subscription.

But don’t worry, you can still try out this feature for free by starting a [7-day trial of the premium subscription](https://frenzygames.net/custom/premium). To do this, simply tap on the red padlock icon and follow the instructions on the screen. You will not be charged until the trial period ends. You can cancel your subscription at any time before the trial ends if you do not wish to continue.

Once you have activated your trial or your premium subscription, you will be able to play 400 piece puzzles without any restrictions. You will also enjoy other benefits of the premium subscription, such as:

1. Access to over 2000 puzzles in all categories and themes
1. No ads and interruptions to distract you from your puzzle-solving experience
1. Regular updates with new puzzles

The premium subscription costs only $14.99 per month or $12.49 per month when purchasing a yearly plan. That’s a great deal considering that you will get unlimited access to all the puzzles and features in the game. Plus, you will save more than 15% when you choose the yearly plan over the monthly plan.

We hope that you will enjoy playing 400 piece puzzles in Jigsaw Puzzle Frenzy and experience the thrill of solving the most complex and beautiful puzzles in the game. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to [contact us](https://frenzygames.net/custom/contact).
