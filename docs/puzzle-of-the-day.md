Do you love jigsaw puzzles? Do you enjoy challenging yourself and competing with other players? Do you want to win coins and gems while having fun? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you will love [Puzzle of the Day](https://frenzygames.net/custom/pod)!

Puzzle of the Day is a special section of the game where you can play a free puzzle every day. The puzzle is randomly selected from our huge puzzle library, so you never know what you will get. It could be a beautiful landscape, a cute animal, a famous landmark, or anything else. The puzzle can be played in any difficulty mode, and you have to complete it as fast as you can. The faster you finish, the higher your score will be.

But that’s not all. Puzzle of the Day is also a competition where you can compete with other players from around the world. You can see your rank and score on the leaderboard, and compare your performance with others. The top 10 players of the day will be rewarded with coins, which you can use to buy more puzzles, convert to gems, or unlock other features in the game.

Gems are a special game currency that you can use to play Puzzle of the Day. It costs only 1 gem to participate in Puzzle of the Day, and you can get gems by converting coins to gems or by purchasing gems with cash. You can also earn gems by completing achievements, watching ads, or inviting friends to play the game.

Puzzle of the Day is a great way to test your skills, have fun, and win prizes. You can play Puzzle of the Day for only 1 gem every day for 3 months during the trial period. After the trial expires, you can continue playing Puzzle of the Day, but the participation cost will increase from 1 gem to 100 gems. This is to ensure that only the most dedicated and passionate players can enjoy this feature.

However, if you don’t want to pay 100 gems per day, you can also choose to purchase a [Premium subscription](https://frenzygames.net/custom/premium) that grants you unlimited access to Puzzle of the Day along with many other benefits. With a Premium subscription, you can:
