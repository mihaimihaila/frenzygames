We are committed to maintaining a fair and enjoyable gaming environment for all players. This policy outlines our stance on cheating and the actions we will take to preserve game integrity.

## Definition of Cheating

Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

* Exploiting game bugs or glitches.
* Manipulating game data or code.

## Consequences of Cheating

If a player is found to be cheating, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Investigation**: The player's account will be placed under investigation. During this time, the account may be temporarily suspended.
1. **Evidence Request**: The player will be asked to provide evidence of their gameplay, such as video footage or a detailed explanation of their strategy.
1. **Permanent Suspension**: If the player fails to provide satisfactory evidence within 72 hours, or if the evidence confirms cheating, the account suspension will become permanent.

## Reporting Cheating

If you suspect a player is cheating, please report it to our support team. Include as much detail as possible to aid our investigation.
