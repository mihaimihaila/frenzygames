        <h1>Moving All Pieces</h1>

<p>The game includes a helpful feature that lets you move all individual jigsaw puzzle pieces on the board at once. This can be especially useful when you want to reorganize your workspace, clear space for solving, or simply refresh the layout to spark new ideas.</p>
<p>There are three available commands:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>To Right</strong> â€“ moves all pieces to the right side of the board. This is great if you prefer solving puzzles from left to right or want to clear the left side for sorting.</li>
<li><strong>To Left</strong> â€“ shifts all pieces to the left side of the board. Ideal for those who like working from right to left or want to free up the right side for assembling.</li>
<li><strong>Shuffle</strong> â€“ scatters all pieces randomly across the board. Perfect for mixing things up when you're stuck or want a fresh start.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<table style="width: 100%;">
    <tr>
        <td style="float:left">
            <img src='../images/controls/move-pieces.webp?w=100' alt='Move all individual pieces commands' width='100'/>
        </td>    
    </tr>
</table>
            </p>
<p>Tapping any of these buttons will instantly move all pieces on the board. Whether you're puzzling during a relaxing evening or taking a quick break between tasks, these commands help you reset your board with ease and intention.</p>
<h2>Preventing Accidental Moves</h2>
<p>To help avoid accidental taps â€” especially when you're deep in focus or multitasking â€” you can enable a <strong>Confirmation dialog</strong> in the gameâ€™s Settings.</p>
<p>This is a great option if youâ€™re playing with kids nearby, juggling other tasks, or simply want peace of mind while puzzling. It adds a layer of control and comfort, so you can focus on enjoying the game without worrying about unintended rearrangements.</p>
<p>
<table style="width: 100%;">
    <tr>
        <td style="float:left">
            <img src='../images/settings/confirmation-dialog.webp?w=800' alt='Turn on Confirmation dialog in Settings' width='800'/>
        </td>    
    </tr>
</table>
            </p>
<p>When this setting is turned on, the game will display a confirmation dialog before any pieces are moved. This dialog ensures that your progress isnâ€™t disrupted by an unintended tap.</p>
<h2>How the Confirmation Dialog Works</h2>
<p>When the dialog appears, youâ€™ll be given two clear options:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Move pieces</strong> â€“ confirms your action and moves all puzzle pieces as requested.</li>
<li><strong>Cancel</strong> â€“ dismisses the dialog and keeps your puzzle exactly as it is.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<table style="width: 100%;">
    <tr>
        <td style="float:left">
            <img src='../images/dialogs/confirm-move.webp?w=600' alt='Move all individual pieces commands' width='600'/>
        </td>    
    </tr>
</table>
            </p>
<p>This feature is especially helpful for players who value precision and control. Itâ€™s also a thoughtful addition for anyone who prefers a slower, more mindful puzzling experience â€” whether you're solving solo or sharing the game with family.</p>
<p>These movement tools and safety settings are designed to make your experience smoother, more intuitive, and tailored to your play style. Whether you're a seasoned puzzler or just getting started, youâ€™ll find that these features help you stay organized, focused, and in control.</p>
<p>Happy puzzling ðŸ§©ðŸ’œ</p>
