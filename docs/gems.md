## Gems

![Gem](gem.png?h=48)

Gems are used for playing Puzzle of the Day.
Playing Puzzle of the Day costs **1 gem**.
_When playing the game multiple times the cost increases: e.g. playing Puzzle of the Day 2 times costs 2 gems, playing 3 times costs 3 gems, etc.)._
Gems can be earned by converting coins into gems.
Gems are more valuable than coins.

**1 gem = 300 coins**

You can convert coins to gems or crowns in your [game account](https://frenzygames.net/custom/account).
