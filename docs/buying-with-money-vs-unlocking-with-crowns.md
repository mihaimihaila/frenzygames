There are two ways to get puzzle packs in our games:

## Buy with money

If you choose to buy with money, the purchase will be handled through Microsoft. You need to log in to your Microsoft Account and link it to a method of paying. Read [**How to purchase**](how-to-purchase.md) for more details.

### Advantages of buying puzzles with money

* There are no ads when you play puzzles purchased with money
* Once you set up your Microsoft Account for purchases, the payment method is saved and you can purchase more puzzle packs in the future with ease
* Every time you buy a puzzle pack with money, you also earn crowns. You earn 3 crowns for regular puzzle packs or 12 crowns for bundles.

## Unlock with crowns

If you choose to unlock puzzle packs with crowns, you need to create a game account and collect enough crowns in your game account to unlock a puzzle pack. Read [**Game Economy**](game-rewards.md) for more details.

### Advantages of unlocking puzzles with crowns

* You skip adding a payment method
* You earn 17 crowns by completing missions, and 30 crowns each time when you invite a friend
* You earn crowns by playing every day

### Notice

* Puzzle packs unlocked with crowns contain ads
* You can also purchase crowns with money

## Conclusion

* The easiest and fastest way to get puzzles is to purchase them with money. Puzzles purchased with money do not contain ads.
* If you don't mind ads, you can unlock puzzles for free with the crowns you earn in the game
