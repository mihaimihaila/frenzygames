There are two types of accounts used in the game, each for a different purpose.

## Microsoft Account

Your **Microsoft Account** is used for purchasing puzzles. Purchases are safely handled by Microsoft.
This account is the same account you log into Windows. It is important to use the same Microsoft Account if you get a new computer so that all your purchases you perform on the old computer will be available on the new computer.
