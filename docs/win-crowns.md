![Puzzle of the Day](https://puzzlefrenzy.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/get-in-the-top-3-of-the-puzzle-of-the-day.png?w=600)

Each day we offer a new, free puzzle that you can choose to play in different modes of difficulty. If you get a high score and stay in the top three of the competition until the end of the day, you can earn **1 crown**.

The number of points you can get in the daily challenge increases in direct proportion with the number of jigsaw pieces you choose to solve the puzzle. In other words, you get more points if you choose to solve the Puzzle of the Day with more pieces. Solve it in record time, and you’ll increase your chances to get in the top three of the daily competition.

Each daily competition finishes around midnight US Eastern time, 8 AM European time.

Simply put, the crowns you collect in each of these games will be saved and added to your game account. When you’re ready to buy with crowns, you can decide on a pack in any of these games.

The games that use crowns are also the ones that offer a Puzzle of the Day competition. That means that you can increase your chances of earning more crowns by solving the Puzzle of the Day in any of these 5 games. Choose the games and the difficulty modes where you think you are most likely to get ranked in the first 3 positions in the competition, and you can earn yourself extra crowns on a daily basis.
