<h1>How to Purchase Puzzles and Subscriptions</h1>
<p>Author: <em>Silvia</em>, last modified: <em>02/27/2021</em></p>
<br/>
<p>You can purchase puzzles and subscriptions using any of the following credit / debit card types: Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover, or with PayPal depending on your country of residence.</p>
<p>The game uses <strong>Microsoft Store</strong> to safely perform purchases.</p>
<p>In order to be able to pay on the Microsoft Store, your Microsoft account has to be linked to your credit card or PayPal account.</p>
<p>You decide what payment method you want to use from your Microsoft account.</p>
<h2>How to add a payment method to your Microsoft account</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/payments/"><strong>Payment &amp; billing</strong></a> on your Microsoft account</li>
<li>On the Payment & billing page, you will see a Payment methods section. Tap on <strong>Add a new payment method</strong></li>
<li>A side menu will open to the right side of your screen. Fill in the required fields, and tap <strong>Save</strong> if you chose credit or debit card, or <strong>Next</strong> if you selected PayPal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you successfully added a payment method to your Microsoft account using the steps above, <strong>return to the game and purchase puzzles or subscriptions</strong>. When you have completed a purchase, you gain instant access to the puzzles in the pack, and your subscription plan is activated immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Notice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough money on your credit / debit card or PayPal account to purchase.</li>
<li>The PayPal payment method is available only in certain countries.</li>
<li>If you experience problems adding your payment method to your Microsoft account, we recommend contacting <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/contact-microsoft-store-support-4f615f2a-6bbd-fd69-6695-ae213d63eef0">Microsoft Store Support</a>.</li>
