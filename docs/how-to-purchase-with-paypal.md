The game uses **Microsoft Store** to safely perform purchases.

In order to be able to pay with PayPal on the Microsoft Store, you will need to add your PayPal account to your Microsoft account.

## How to set up PayPal on your Microsoft account

To configure your PayPal account with your Microsoft account, follow these steps:

1. Go to [**Payment &amp; billing**](https://account.microsoft.com/billing/payments/) on your Microsoft account
1. On the Payment & billing page, you will see a Payment methods section. Tap on **Add a new payment method**
1. A side menu will open to the right of your screen. Scroll down, select PayPal and tap __Next__. You will then need to log in to your PayPal account to verify your account. If you don't see any more prompts, you have finished the payment configuration.

Once you successfully added PayPal payment method to your Microsoft account using the steps above, **return to the game and purchase puzzles or subscriptions**. When you have completed a purchase, you gain instant access to the puzzles in the pack, and your subscription plan is activated immediately.

### Notice

* Make sure you have enough credit on your PayPal account to purchase.

* Please note that the PayPal payment method is available only in certain countries.
