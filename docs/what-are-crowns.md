Crowns are rewards you get in the game. The crowns can be spent on unlocking puzzle packs. When you have crowns available for spending an additional button will appear in the Store next to the money price. 

A typical puzzle pack costs **30 crowns**, but some packs have higher or lower cost depending on the number of puzzles in the pack and the release date.

Puzzle Bundles (several puzzle packs sold together) cost **75 crowns**.
