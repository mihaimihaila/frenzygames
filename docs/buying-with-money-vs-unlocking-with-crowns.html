<p>There are two ways to get puzzle packs in our games:</p>
<h2>Buy with money</h2>
<p>If you choose to buy with money, the purchase will be handled through Microsoft. You need to log in to your Microsoft Account and link it to a method of paying. Read <a href="https://mihaimihaila.github.io/frenzygames/docs/how-to-purchase.html"><strong>How to purchase</strong></a> for more details.</p>
<h3>Advantages of buying puzzles with money</h3>
<ul>
<li>there are no ads when you play puzzles purchased with money</li>
<li>once you set up your Microsoft Account for purchases, the payment method is saved and you can purchase more puzzle packs in the future with ease</li>
<li>every time you buy a puzzle pack with money, you also earn crowns. You earn 3 crowns for regular puzzle packs or 12 crowns for bundles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unlock with crowns</h2>
<p>If you choose to unlock puzzle packs with crowns, you need to create a game account and collect enough crowns in your game account to unlock a puzzle pack. Read <a href="https://mihaimihaila.github.io/frenzygames/docs/what-are-crowns.html"><strong>What are crowns</strong></a> for more details.</p>
<h3>Advantages of unlocking puzzles with crowns</h3>

</ul>
<h3>Notice</h3>

</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>The easiest and fastest way to get puzzles is to purchase them with money. Puzzles purchased with money do not contain ads.</li>
