The game contains two types of rewards: coins ![Coin Reward](coin.png?w=48) and crowns ![Crown Reward](crown.png?w=48)

## Coins ![Coin Reward](coin.png?w=48)

Coins are earned by solving puzzles.

## Crowns ![Crown Reward](crown.png?w=48)

Crowns are used for unlocking puzzles. Crowns can be earned or purchased. When you own crowns, an additional button appears in the Puzzle Store, allowing you to unlock puzzles with crowns.

## Exchange rate

Crowns are more valuable than coins.

1 x ![Crown Reward](crown.png?w=48) = 40.000 x ![Coin Reward](coin.png?w=48)

You can exchange coins for crowns in your [game account](https://frenzygames.net/custom/account).

A typical puzzle pack costs **30 crowns**. The crowns cost depends on the number of puzzles in the pack and the release date of the pack. The more puzzles a pack contains, the more crowns it costs. The more recent a pack is, the more crowns it costs.

Puzzle Bundles cost **100 crowns**.
