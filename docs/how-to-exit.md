By default the game runs in fullscreen. To exit the fullscreen mode go to **Home page** &rarr; **Arrow down button** (in the top-right corner) &rarr; **Exit fullscreen**.

Alternatively, you can move the mouse to the very top right corner and wait for a second until the **X** button appears, then close the game.
