You can purchase puzzles and subscriptions using any of the following credit / debit card types: Visa, MasterCard, American Expres and Discover, or with PayPal depending on your country of residence.

The game uses **Microsoft Store** to safely perform purchases.

In order to be able to pay on the Microsoft Store, your Microsoft account has to be linked to your credit card or PayPal account.

You decide what payment method you want to use from your Microsoft account.

## How to add a payment method to your Microsoft account

1. Go to [**Payment &amp; billing**](https://account.microsoft.com/billing/payments/) on your Microsoft account
1. On the Payment & billing page, you will see a Payment methods section. Tap on **Add a new payment method**
1. A side menu will open to the right side of your screen. Fill in the required fields, and tap **Save** if you chose credit or debit card, or __Next__ if you selected PayPal.

Once you successfully added a payment method to your Microsoft account using the steps above, **return to the game and purchase puzzles or subscriptions**. When you have completed a purchase, you gain instant access to the puzzles in the pack, and your subscription plan is activated immediately.

**Please note:**

* Make sure you have enough money on your credit / debit card or PayPal account to purchase.

* The PayPal payment method is available only in certain countries.

* If you experience problems adding your payment method to your Microsoft account, we recommend contacting [Microsoft Store Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/contact-microsoft-store-support-4f615f2a-6bbd-fd69-6695-ae213d63eef0).
