**Question**: I just bought a new PC. How do I get the puzzles from my old PC to the new PC?

**Answer**: Congratulations on your new PC. You can the game again from the Microsoft Store using the same Microsoft Account that you used to purchase them. All the puzzle you purchased on your old PC will automatically be transfered to your new PC.

Once you install the game make sure you sign in with the same Frenzy Games Account in order to restore any puzzles that you unlocked with crowns.
