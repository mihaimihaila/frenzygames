        <b>Great Jigsaw puzzle</b> by PlumGnu26081772
    </p>
    <p class="zeroTopMargin">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
    <p class="zeroTopMargin;">I like the colorful beaches. I also like there is not much competing, just leisurely putting the puzzle together. I liked the beginning instructions too. Most apps expect you to work it out by yourself. Being 83yrs old I just want to enjoy what apps I choose.</p>
