        <h2>Missing Puzzle Packs: October 2023</h2>
<p><em>12.10.2023</em></p>
<p>Dear players,</p>
<p>In the last few days we noticed some issues related to purchases our games. These issues appear to be caused by Microsoft Store. These issues manifest in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have purchased puzzles in the past, some of those puzzles appear to be missing</li>
<li>Without purchasing a subscription, a Premium subscription appears to be active</li>
</ol>
<p>These issues are caused by Microsoft Store and appear to be affecting only some Windows 11 users. These issues are temporary and appear to be caused by a faulty Windows Update.</p>
<p>To solve these problems follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install any pending Windows Updates</li>
<li>Restart your computer and try again</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for your patience!</p>
