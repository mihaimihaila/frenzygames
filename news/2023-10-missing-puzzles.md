# Missing Puzzle Packs: October 2023

_12.10.2023_

Dear players,
In the last few days we noticed some issues related to purchases our games. These issues appear to be caused by Microsoft Store. These issues manifest in two ways:

1. If you have purchased puzzles in the past, some of those puzzles appear to be missing
1. Without purchasing a subscription, a Premium subscription appears to be active

These issues are caused by Microsoft Store and appear to be affecting only some Windows 11 users. These issues are temporary and appear to be caused by a faulty Windows Update.

To solve these problems follow these instructions:

1. Install any pending Windows Updates
1. Restart your computer and try again

Thank you for your patience!
